Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

 It's commonly used in scenarios where exactly one instance of a class is needed throughout the application lifecycle, such as configuration settings, logging, database connections, and thread pools.

```
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation from outside
    private Singleton() {}

    // Lazy initialization with double-checked locking
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
    
    // Other methods and properties
}

```
