The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. 

It involves creating new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype, instead of creating them from scratch.

```
interface Prototype {  
  
     public Prototype getClone();  
      
}//

class EmployeeRecord implements Prototype{  
      
   private int id;  
   private String name, designation;  
   private double salary;  
   private String address;  
        
 public  EmployeeRecord(int id, String name, String designation, double salary, String address) {  
          
        this();  
        this.id = id;  
        this.name = name;  
        this.designation = designation;  
        this.salary = salary;  
        this.address = address;  
    }  
      
  public void showRecord(){  
          
        System.out.println(id+"\t"+name+"\t"+designation+"\t"+salary+"\t"+address);  
   }  
  
    @Override  
    public Prototype getClone() {  
  
        return new EmployeeRecord(id,name,designation,salary,address);  
    }  
}

class PrototypeDemo{  
     public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {  
        // pass values      
        EmployeeRecord e1=new EmployeeRecord(eid,ename,edesignation,esalary,eaddress);  
          
        e1.showRecord();  
        System.out.println("\n");
  //clone it
        EmployeeRecord e2=(EmployeeRecord) e1.getClone();  
        e2.showRecord();  
    }     
}//End of the ProtoypeDemo class.
